This project delves into the realm of cosmic knowledge, utilizing advanced technology to unravel the mysteries of celestial bodies. Leveraging the powerful Software Development Kit (SDK) of Swiss Ephemeris, I have engineered a sophisticated system capable of calculating detailed birth charts. The application offers a comprehensive view of the cosmos, providing precise positions of planets, sunrise and sunset timings, and a multitude of other celestial data points.

By harnessing the capabilities of the Swiss Ephemeris SDK, the project goes beyond simple astrological predictions. It accurately calculates and presents the positions of celestial entities, offering users a profound insight into the cosmic alignment during their birth. The application provides a comprehensive overview of the planetary positions, allowing enthusiasts to explore the intricate dance of planets in the cosmic ballet.

From planetary alignments to sunrise and sunset times, the project offers a wealth of cosmic information. Enthusiasts and researchers can delve deep into the nuances of celestial events, gaining a profound understanding of the universe's intricate workings. The project stands as a testament to the fusion of astronomical knowledge and cutting-edge technology, empowering users to explore the cosmos in unprecedented detail.
